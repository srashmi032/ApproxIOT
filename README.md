# Approximate-Analysis-of-Real-Time-Stream-Data

Based on the following research paper:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8416311

Problem Statement:The data is generated by group of IOT devices like sensors etc forming continuous streams of data.This stream is collected another group of devices called edge devices that filter or preprocesses the data.We sample the data collected by different edge devices.The algorithm selects a sample of egde devices i.e. a subsample of the whole data stream on to all edge devices. At a particular instant of time. In that instant, m IOT devices send a stream of data to n edge devices.But we sample the data collected by k edge devices where k<=n.
